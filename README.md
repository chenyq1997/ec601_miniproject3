App Development: Android Studio v. React Native

React Native is a JavaScript-based development environment that enables developers to use one basic code to simutaneously develop both Android and iOS apps. It has a 'declarative UI' that interacts with native APIs. (https://facebook.github.io/react-native/)
To make comparisons a simple tally counter app is developed using both React Native and Android Studio.
Android Studio is more like a full-fledge developer's kit, with GUI component edit and more complete workflow management. React Native has the 'magic' intepretation but leaves the bare code on developers' own hands: they can (and have to) choose their own tool to deal with the JS code. That means the fluency in JS decides the efficiency in React Native.
In conclusion, if the dev team seeks a cost effective way to make cross-platform projects then React Native is the go-to. If, however, the dev team predicts great complexity in the project, they should use respective official developer environments. The two options are not mutually exclusive; their combination may well improve development experience.
